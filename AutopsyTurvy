## Introductions first and foremost!


Many happy greetings!
I'm Kitty! (Chaotic-Good): currently a student at Noroff school, slowly chipping away at the galaxy of things you should know as a Front End Developer!
Slowly building up stats and levelling up!

<br>

Coding was not a decision that I took lightly, and quite a life changing decision after having already spent more than two decades as an artist. After having been there and gotten the degree, I decided to jump into another form of creativity.
Though this new one does not consist of fabric, paint or paper, I find the creative potential so exciting!


So far I've had the privilege of diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript- but I wait with baited breath to also delve into 
other frameworks that can expand my toolkit and allow me to bring my creative visions to life -- I expect my educational journey and following career to be one of constant growth and endless curiosity.


I enjoy trying to incorperate illustration into my work, and intend to develop this as my education progresses - Hopefully with more and more finesse! I aim to further refine my skills and contribute to projects that make the digital world a more inclusive, beautiful, and engaging place. 
    
I still keep my artwork close by, of course... if I get a break from schoolwork I still dust off the pencils or sewing machine. 
I can't be sitting at a desk all day with out quilts, blankets, cosy artwork or comfortable dresses, can I?
I also recently started dipping into animation!
