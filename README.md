### How do you do fellow kids?



## Introductions first and foremost!


Many happy greetings!
I'm Kitty! (Chaotic-Good): soon to be graduate of Noroff school, poised to enter the world of Front End Development as a full time job, and excited to put all I have built to use and see where it takes me and my fellow classmates!

<br>

After having already spent more than two decades as an artist, I am looking forward to experimenting with mixing mediums and textures for an "organic" feel to websites- the potential for design and feel is so exciting!
I enjoy trying to incorperate illustration into my work, and intend to develop this as my education progresses - Hopefully with more and more finesse! I aim to further refine my skills and contribute to projects that make the digital world a more inclusive, beautiful, and engaging place. 

This last year at school introduced us to those all familiar Bootstrap, Tailwind and CSS Modules- (the latter being my most valued friend but shhh, don't tell the others!), and more complex JavaScript than ever before- there were some really interesting brain twisters in there, that's for sure! 
I feel I have come out of this year with a much better understanding of how things need to be laid out, and how things on a page can interact- I hope all of us at Noroff feel stronger for it!

I have recently acquired Procreate Dreams specifically for animation, so I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do with combined art and code skills!
